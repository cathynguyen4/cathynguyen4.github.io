			<p>It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking down from an airplane onto this earth. What we see is a free flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles, circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by shapes of great regularity. Here we have, then, natural and man-made forms in contradistinction. And here before us we can recognize the essence of designing a visually comprehensible, simplified organization of forms that is distinct from nature’s secretive and complex working.</p>

			<p>Or on a beach, we may find a button, a bottle, a plank of wood, immediately recognizable as “our” doing, belonging to our world of forms and not to that which made the shells, the seaweed, and the undulated tracings of waves on sand...</p>

			<p>“…when the matter of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric.”</p>

		<section class="span-3">
			<p>To turn from “looking at” to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted by nature’s fanciful way of planting to scatter them freely about...</p>

			<p>If, then, it appears that our stamp is or should be an immediate or implicit lucidity... we have established a basis for designing — designing in any field.</p>

		<section class="span-3">
			<p>By using the term “designing” for all these varied ways of pre-establishing form, we are, of course, doing some violence to the word...</p>

			<p>“Culture, surely, is measured by art, which sets the standard of quality toward which broad production slowly moves or should move.”</p>

		<section class="span-6">
			<p>For we certainly realize that there are no exclusive materials reserved for art...</p>
			<p>Today, we should try to counteract habits that only rarely leave us time to collect ourselves...</p>

			<p>“Nevertheless, we are seldom found — on train or plane, on bus or boat, or in any given moment of imposed restraint of action — without a bundle of distractions in our hand….”</p>

		<section class="span-6">
			<p>And though it may appear that we are straying from our line of thought, it is on the contrary here on the ground of philosophy and morals...</p>

			<p>“…the designer who takes the longer view is by no means identical with the ‘successful’ designer.”</p>

			<p>As you will have noticed, I have made no distinction between the craftsman designer, the industrial designer, and the artist...</p>
			<p>Material form becomes meaningful form through design, that is, through considered relationships...</p>

			<h2>About the Author</h2>

			<p>Anni Albers (1899–1994) was a German-born textile artist, printmaker, and writer who became one of the most influential designers of the twentieth century. She studied at the Bauhaus in Germany, where she later led the weaving workshop. At a time when weaving was often considered merely decorative or domestic, Albers elevated it into a serious modern art form by focusing on structure, material, and visual organization.</p>

			<p>After the Bauhaus closed in 1933, she emigrated to the United States and taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where she helped shape modern American design education. In 1949, she became the first textile artist to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Through her teaching, writing, and experimental work, Albers redefined weaving as both art and disciplined design, emphasizing clarity, structure, and thoughtful form.</p>
