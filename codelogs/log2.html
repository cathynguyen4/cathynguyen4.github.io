	<h2>Absolute vs. Relative CSS Length Units</h2>

	<p>
	When working in CSS, it’s important to understand the difference between absolute and relative units. 
	Absolute units are fixed. That means they do not change based on screen size, parent elements, or user settings. 
	Examples include <code>px</code> and <code>pt</code>. These units try to stay the same size no matter what.
	</p>

	<p>
	Relative units, on the other hand, are based on something else. They adjust depending on the font size, 
	the root element, or even the size of the browser window. Examples include <code>em</code>, 
	<code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>, and <code>vh</code>. Relative units are extremely useful for responsive design 
	because they scale naturally across devices. In modern web development, relative units are often preferred 
	because they improve flexibility and accessibility.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>1. px and pt</h2>

	<p>
	The <code>px</code> unit stands for pixel. It is the most common unit used in web design. 
	Even though pixels seem absolute, they are actually CSS pixels, meaning they are adjusted 
	by the browser to look consistent across different devices. Pixels are good for borders, 
	icons, and small layout details.
	</p>

	<p>
	The <code>pt</code> unit stands for point. It is mostly used in print design. 
	One point equals 1/72 of an inch. On screens, it is less common and not recommended 
	for responsive layouts.
	</p>

	<textarea>
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 24pt;
}
	</textarea>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>2. em and rem</h2>

	<p>
	The <code>em</code> unit is relative to the font size of its parent element. 
	If a parent has a font size of 20px, then 1em equals 20px. 
	This can sometimes cause compounding effects when elements are nested.
	</p>

	<p>
	The <code>rem</code> unit stands for "root em." It is relative to the root 
	HTML element’s font size instead of the parent. This makes it more predictable 
	and easier to control in larger layouts. Many developers prefer <code>rem</code> 
	for consistent typography.
	</p>

	<textarea>
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}

h2 {
    font-size: 2rem;
}

p {
    font-size: 1.2em;
}
	</textarea>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>3. vw and vh</h2>

	<p>
	The <code>vw</code> unit stands for viewport width. One <code>vw</code> equals 
	1% of the browser window’s width. The <code>vh</code> unit stands for viewport height, 
	and 1vh equals 1% of the browser window’s height.
	</p>

	<p>
	These units are especially useful for full-screen layouts, hero sections, 
	and responsive typography that scales with screen size. However, they should 
	be used carefully on mobile devices because browser toolbars can affect 
	the viewport height.
	</p>

	<textarea>
.hero {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 5vw;
}
	</textarea>
